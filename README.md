# Chat Application

A simple chat application built with **Slim Framework 4**, using an **SQLite database** and **Symfony Cache** for caching, designed with a **layered architecture**. This ensures better code organization and maintainability.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality with JWT token.
- **Private Messaging**: Users can send direct messages to each other.
- **Group Messaging**: Allows multiple users to communicate in a shared chat.
- **Media Uploads**: Users can share images and files within conversations.

## Database Design & API Routes

The database is designed for a small-scale chat application supporting **10,000 users/year**, with each user sending around **5 messages per day**.

For larger applications with high loads, itâ€™s recommended to:
- Separate **private messages** and **group messages** into different tables for better organization and performance.
- Use **sharded databases** to distribute data across multiple servers, improving scalability and reducing bottlenecks.
- Implement **read and write database replication** to distribute query loads effectively and ensure high availability.
- Introduce **event-driven architecture** with message queues (e.g., **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**) to handle high-throughput message processing asynchronously.
- Utilize **rate limiting** and **API throttling** to prevent abuse and improve system stability.

The API routes follow a RESTful design, ensuring easy integration with frontend clients.

## Future Improvements
This version of the application is functional but can be improved for better performance and scalability. Here are some recommended enhancements:

- **Real-time Communication**: Implement **WebSockets** instead of HTTP-based messaging to enable instant message delivery and improve the overall user experience.
- **Cloud Storage**: Store media files in **object storage solutions**, such as **AWS S3**, to reduce storage limitations, enhance scalability, and improve availability.
- **Reliable Database**: Upgrade from SQLite to **MySQL** for handling larger user bases and better transaction performance.
- **Improved Caching**: Use **Memcached** or **Redis** for efficient data retrieval, reducing database queries and improving response times.
- **Database Optimization**: Add indexing to frequently accessed tables like `messages` and `users` to speed up query execution and reduce latency.
- **Robust ORM**: Switch to **Doctrine** for more efficient database management, making it easier to handle complex queries and relationships.
- **Admin Panel**: Develop an admin dashboard for user moderation, handling reported messages, and managing system-wide configurations.
- **Notifications**: Implement notification routes and real-time alerts for user activity such as new messages, friend requests, and group invitations.
- **More Tests**: Expand unit and integration tests to cover additional scenarios, ensuring a more reliable and bug-free application.
